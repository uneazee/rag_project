The try block contains code that may raise an exception, and the except block contains code that will be executed if an exception is raised.\n\nExample:\n```\ntry:\n    f = open('myfile.txt')\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...\")\n```\n\nSource: [8. Errors and Exceptions \u2014 Python 3.14.2 documentation.pdf]",
